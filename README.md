Software Design Project for The Gaming Room

The Gaming Room requested a redesign of their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application that could run on multiple platforms. The goal was to create a design that maintained the core gameplay while improving accessibility and scalability across devices.

The design document aimed to clearly communicate how the system would function, including the use of appropriate design patterns and well-structured components. The focus was on making the information easy to follow for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.

Following a step-by-step design process—starting with client needs, identifying constraints, and outlining key components—helped keep the project organized and on track. This structured approach also simplified future development.

One area for improvement would be the domain model, which could be expanded to better show the relationships between system components. This would make it even easier for developers to understand the overall structure at a glance.

The final design reflects the user’s needs by ensuring cross-platform functionality and a consistent, engaging experience. Prioritizing the user and client expectations is essential in any design process to create software that’s both functional and user-friendly.

Looking ahead, this experience reinforced the value of planning before coding, using proven patterns, and designing with clarity and purpose.
